# Google Address Markers

Welcome, this is a simple script I made one evening to put pins on a google map with some extra info. I made it because I have just moved to Auckland and I am looking for a flat.

I then decided to put it online, in the process of tidying it up I also wanted to see what the latest in best practices for JS were.
